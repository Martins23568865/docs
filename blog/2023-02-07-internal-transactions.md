Weâ€™re excited to announce that today we have launched internal transactions across a number of our most popular EVM chains!

Real-time and historical internal transactions are now available across Ethereum, Sepolia, Polygon, Mumbai, BSC and BSC testnet. For complete coverage, please see the table outlined here.

Internal transactions have been added on three existing endpoints by introducing a new query parameter `include` that supports `internal_transactions` as an input:

- [Get native transactions by wallet](/web3-data-api/reference/get-wallet-transactions)
- [Get transaction by hash](/web3-data-api/reference/get-transaction)
- [Get block by hash](/web3-data-api/reference/get-block)

We have also launched a new endpoint that specifically fetches internal transactions for a given transaction hash:

- [Get internal transactions by transaction hash](/web3-data-api/reference/get-internal-transactions)
